## Instruction Files

Instructions are split out into multiple files for application across different contexts and use cases:

- [Project Wide Instructions](instructions/project.instructions.md)
- [Terminal Instructions](instructions/terminal.instructions.md)
- [R Coding Instructions](instructions/r.instructions.md)
- [Context and Memory Instructions](instructions/context.instructions.md)

## General Guidelines

- Work incrementally by completing small, focused tasks.
- Leverage your memory and sequential thinking for performing tasks and ensuring you have the necessary context.
- Utilize available tools and resources effectively to enhance your productivity.
- After completing a task, take a moment to reflect on what you've learned and how it can be applied to future tasks,
  then update your memory with this knowledge.
