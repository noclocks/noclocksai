# Enhancing Data Drive API Workflows in R with `ellmer`

> Prompt: 
> `Help me understand how augmenting API wrapper functions and workflows in R with AI via the ellmer package and tool calling enhances data driven API workflows and pipelines compared to without AI`.

The R programming language has long been a powerful tool for data scientists and developers working with APIs and data pipelines. Traditional API workflows in R typically involve writing custom functions to make HTTP requests, parse responses, handle errors, and process returned data. While effective, these approaches often require significant manual coding and maintenance. The recent introduction of the `ellmer` package (released in early 2025) represents a paradigm shift by enabling AI-augmented API workflows through tool calling capabilities. This report examines how ellmer's integration of AI with R functions enhances data-driven API workflows and creates more intelligent, flexible, and user-friendly data pipelines.

## Understanding the ellmer Package and LLM Tool Calling

The ellmer package provides a unified interface for interacting with various Large Language Models (LLMs) from R. Developed by the tidyverse team, including Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng, and Aaron Jacobs, ellmer supports a wide variety of LLM providers including OpenAI, Claude, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, and many others[^1_1][^1_9]. The package implements features such as streaming outputs, tool/function calling, structured data extraction, and asynchronous processing, making it a comprehensive solution for integrating AI capabilities into R workflows[^1_1].

At the core of ellmer's power for enhancing API workflows is its implementation of tool calling (also known as function calling). Tool calling is a feature that allows LLMs to perform tasks beyond simple text generation by invoking predefined functions. This capability significantly enhances the interaction between humans and AI applications, allowing for more complex and structured outputs[^1_4]. In essence, tool calling enables an AI model to use external tools, such as APIs and functions, to respond to prompts with more than just text. For example, rather than generating a speculative response about weather conditions, an AI can invoke a function that interacts with a weather API to provide accurate, real-time data[^1_13].

The process of tool calling involves several steps: the AI model analyzes a user's query, determines if external tools or data are needed, decides which function to call and with what parameters, receives the results of the function call, and incorporates those results into a coherent response. This process allows LLMs to act as intelligent intermediaries between users (who may express needs in natural language) and APIs (which require structured requests).

## Implementing AI-Augmented API Workflows with ellmer

Implementing tool calling with ellmer involves a straightforward workflow that begins with creating a chat object connected to an LLM provider. For example, `chat <- chat_openai()` creates a chat object that uses OpenAI's models[^1_5]. Next, developers define R functions that perform specific API-related tasks, such as fetching data from external services, performing calculations, or taking actions based on user input.

These functions are then registered with the chat object using the `register_tool` method, which tells the LLM what functions are available and how to use them[^1_8]. As described in the ellmer documentation: "If the chatbot decides to use the function, ellmer will automatically call it and submit the results back"[^1_8]. This automation of the tool calling loop is one of ellmer's most powerful features, as it handles the complex back-and-forth between the LLM and the registered functions.

A practical example from the search results demonstrates how to implement weather data retrieval through tool calling[^1_7]. The developer creates a function that fetches weather data from an API, registers it with ellmer, and then users can ask about the weather in natural language. The LLM will analyze the request, determine that it needs to call the weather function, extract the necessary parameters (such as location and time), execute the function with those parameters, and then incorporate the real-time weather data into its response.

## Enhanced Capabilities of AI-Augmented API Workflows

When comparing traditional API workflows in R with AI-augmented ones using ellmer's tool calling capabilities, several significant advantages become apparent:

### Natural Language Interface to Structured APIs

Traditional API workflows require users to understand specific endpoints, parameters, and data structures. With ellmer's tool calling, users can interact with APIs using natural language rather than having to learn technical details[^1_13]. This democratizes access to data by allowing non-technical users to retrieve and analyze information through conversational interfaces. The LLM handles the translation between human language and the structured requirements of APIs, acting as an intelligent intermediary that understands both worlds.

### Contextual Understanding and Adaptive Reasoning

Traditional API wrappers execute exactly as programmed, with no ability to interpret intent or adapt to ambiguous requests. AI-augmented workflows using ellmer can interpret the context of a user's request, maintain awareness throughout a conversation, and adapt to changing requirements without code modifications[^1_7]. The LLM can understand follow-up questions, disambiguate unclear requests, and determine which API calls would best satisfy the user's underlying intent rather than just their explicit query.

### Automated Parameter Selection and Error Handling

In traditional API workflows, developers must explicitly code parameter selection logic and error handling routines. With ellmer, the LLM automatically extracts relevant parameters from natural language requests and can handle errors intelligently[^1_6]. For example, if a user asks about the weather in "Paris today at 5 am local time," the LLM will recognize that it needs to call a weather function with the location parameter "Paris" and the time parameter corresponding to 5 am in Paris's time zone[^1_7]. If the API returns an error, the LLM can interpret it and provide a helpful explanation to the user rather than just displaying a technical error message.

### Dynamic Orchestration of Complex Workflows

Traditional API workflows often require extensive code to orchestrate multiple API calls and process intermediate results. With ellmer, the LLM can dynamically determine which functions to call in what sequence, making decisions based on intermediate results[^1_2]. This enables more flexible and intelligent workflows that can adapt to varying data conditions and user requirements without the need for exhaustive conditional logic in the code.

## Real-World Applications and Benefits

The integration of LLMs with API workflows through ellmer opens up numerous practical applications for data scientists and developers:

### Enhanced Data Retrieval and Analysis

Data scientists can create functions that access various data sources, and then use the LLM to intelligently retrieve, combine, and analyze data based on natural language queries. This allows for more exploratory and iterative data analysis without writing new code for each query variation[^1_10]. For example, a data scientist could register functions for accessing different databases or APIs, and then ask questions that span multiple data sources without having to manually join or transform the data.

### Automated Report Generation

By combining ellmer's tool calling with its text generation capabilities, developers can create systems that automatically gather data through APIs and generate comprehensive reports or visualizations based on that data[^1_10]. The LLM can make intelligent decisions about which data points are relevant, what analysis to perform, and how to present the results in a coherent narrative.

### Interactive Data Applications

Developers building Shiny applications or other interactive tools can use ellmer to create more intelligent interfaces that understand user intent and translate it into appropriate API calls[^1_2]. As the ellmer documentation notes, "if you are using ellmer in a Shiny app, you could use tools to set reactive values, setting off a chain of reactive updates"[^1_2]. This allows for more natural interaction models where users can express complex data needs in plain language.

### Data Pipeline Automation

AI-augmented workflows can automate decision points in data pipelines that previously required human intervention. By registering functions that handle different stages of a data pipeline, the LLM can make intelligent decisions about data routing, transformation, and validation based on the characteristics of the data and the desired outcomes[^1_7].

## Limitations and Considerations

Despite the significant advantages, there are some limitations and considerations when implementing AI-augmented API workflows with ellmer:

### Tool Argument Type Limitations

As noted in the ellmer documentation, "tool arguments come from the chat model, and tool results are returned to the chat model. That means that only simple, {jsonlite} compatible data types can be used as inputs and outputs"[^1_2]. Developers need to be careful about designing functions that work within these constraints, particularly when dealing with complex data structures.

### Token and Context Window Limitations

LLMs have limits on the number of tokens they can process in a single conversation, which can restrict the amount of data that can be passed back and forth through tool calling[^1_12]. Large API responses may need to be summarized or truncated before being returned to the LLM.

### Cost and Performance Considerations

Using commercial LLM providers incurs costs based on token usage, which can add up for frequent API interactions. Additionally, there's additional latency introduced by the LLM processing step compared to direct API calls[^1_9]. Developers need to balance the benefits of AI augmentation against these cost and performance factors.

## Conclusion

The integration of AI capabilities into R's data-driven API workflows through the ellmer package represents a significant advancement in how developers and data scientists interact with external data sources. By bridging the gap between natural language and programmatic APIs, ellmer enables more flexible, intelligent, and user-friendly data pipelines that can adapt to changing requirements without extensive code modifications.

As LLM capabilities continue to evolve and tools like ellmer mature, we can expect even more sophisticated integrations that further streamline data workflows and democratize access to complex data systems. For organizations looking to enhance their data capabilities, AI-augmented API workflows offer a compelling approach that combines the strengths of traditional programming with the adaptive intelligence of modern LLMs.

While traditional API wrapper functions in R will continue to serve important purposes, particularly for performance-critical or highly structured applications, the addition of AI augmentation through tools like ellmer opens up new possibilities for more intuitive, flexible, and powerful data interactions. The future of data workflows in R is likely to be a hybrid approach that leverages both traditional programming and AI capabilities to deliver the best possible user experience and developer productivity.

# Expand on this discussion by providing a detailed example comparing the following workflow with and without AI/ellmer augmentation:

Given an initial dataset with HUD loans property and owner data (see attached xlsx), the goal is to take this data and determine the best approach to take for any properties and owners with a potential investment opportunity as part of an outreach campaign.

Note that the initial data is severely lacking in terms of the owner email addresses. Therefore a significant step in the workflow will be to "enrich" the data with the appropriate contact email address for the owners. This will be accomplished using both the Google maps places (new) API and the Hunter.io email finder API.

The first step, however, would be to initially weed out any records where we know that we will not want to reach out to the owners for whatever reasons so as to not waste resources determining the email. This would involve some sort of scoring or ranking amongst the records as to the best or most attractive investment opporitunities from the data provided.

Next, a stepwise process is needed that identifies the correct company domain to use and then determines the email address via the owner first and last name and the derived domain. To accomplish this, we will primarily leverage the Google maps apis for the domain logic by a) ensuring the owner address is properly formatted by removing blocks of text like "\#400" etc. and deriving the full address by mergine street, city, state and zip and derive a proper "full address" that merges street city state and zip b) geocode and use the places search API using the owner company name and address to get the place details and geographic data from gmaps. The place details should include data for the company website and other useful data that can be cross referenced like phone, business type(s), lat/lon, place ID, etc. c) leverage the hunter.io api by passing it the first and last name and derived domain from the prior step. If an email is found hunter.io will respond with the email address as well as additional data like a "score" and the email verification date. d) assuming everything has worked so far the final step is to assess all relevant data for the record and any enrichment data from these steps to adjust the rankings and finally create an initial email draft to send to the found email address.

The integration of AI into data-driven API workflows represents a significant advancement in how developers and data analysts approach complex data processing tasks. By examining a detailed comparison of traditional API workflows versus AI-augmented workflows using the ellmer package in R, we can see how this integration transforms investment opportunity analysis and outreach processes for HUD loan property data.

## The Investment Opportunity Workflow Challenge

The dataset provided in the Excel file contains extensive information about HUD-financed properties, including details about loan amounts, interest rates, property characteristics, and owner information. This data presents potential investment opportunities, but the workflow to identify and act on these opportunities involves multiple complex steps, including data filtering, enrichment via external APIs, and personalized outreach. A particular challenge is the missing email addresses for property owners, which requires additional data enrichment steps.

## Traditional API Workflow Approach

The traditional approach to processing the HUD loan dataset would involve a series of explicitly coded functions and conditional logic, executed sequentially without adaptability to the specific context of each property.

### Initial Scoring and Filtering

In a traditional workflow, the scoring and filtering of properties would rely on rigid, predefined rules implemented through explicit code:

```r
score_property <- function(property_data) {
  score <- 0
  
  # Loan amount scoring
  if (property_data$loan_amount_mm > 50) {
    score <- score + 3
  } else if (property_data$loan_amount_mm > 30) {
    score <- score + 2
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
  }
  
  # Interest rate scoring
  if (property_data$interest_rate < 3.0) {
    score <- score + 3
  } else if (property_data$interest_rate < 3.5) {
    score <- score + 2
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
  }
  
  # Unit count scoring
  if (property_data$units > 250) {
    score <- score + 3
  } else if (property_data$units > 150) {
    score <- score + 2
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
  }
  
  # Additional scoring factors...
  
  return(score)
}
```

This approach requires developers to anticipate all potential scoring factors and explicitly code their relationships. It lacks adaptability to unexpected patterns in the data and cannot explain its reasoning.

### Address Formatting and API Interaction

The traditional workflow would handle address formatting and API interactions through separate functions with explicit error handling:

```r
format_address <- function(street, city, state, zip) {
  # Remove apartment/suite numbers using regex
  street_cleaned <- gsub("#\\s*\\d+|Suite\\s+\\w+|Ste\\.?\\s+\\w+", "", street, ignore.case = TRUE)
  street_cleaned <- trimws(street_cleaned)
  
  # Combine components
  full_address <- paste(street_cleaned, city, state, zip, sep = ", ")
  
  return(full_address)
}

get_place_details <- function(company_name, address, api_key) {
  # Construct API request
  query <- paste(company_name, address, sep = " ")
  query_encoded <- URLencode(query)
  
  # Call Google Maps Places API
  url <- paste0("https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=", query_encoded, "&key=", api_key)
  response <- GET(url)
  
  # Parse response and handle errors
  if (status_code(response) == 200) {
    data <- fromJSON(content(response, "text", encoding = "UTF-8"))
    # Process results...
  }
  
  # Return NULL if anything fails
  return(NULL)
}
```

These functions work independently without awareness of the broader context. Error handling must be explicitly coded for each possible failure scenario, and there's no automatic adaptation to unexpected data formats or API responses.

### Email Finding and Outreach Creation

In the traditional approach, finding emails and creating outreach messages follows a similar pattern of rigid, rule-based processing:

```r
find_email <- function(first_name, last_name, domain, api_key) {
  # Call Hunter.io API
  url <- paste0("https://api.hunter.io/v2/email-finder?domain=", domain,
                "&first_name=", first_name, "&last_name=", last_name,
                "&api_key=", api_key)
  response <- GET(url)
  
  # Process response
  if (status_code(response) == 200) {
    data <- fromJSON(content(response, "text", encoding = "UTF-8"))
    if (data$data$email) {
      return(data$data$email)
    }
  }
  
  # Fall back to common patterns if Hunter.io fails
  return(paste0(tolower(substr(first_name, 1, 1)), tolower(last_name), "@", domain))
}

create_outreach_email <- function(property_data, contact_data, email) {
  # Template with variable substitution
  template <- "Dear {first_name} {last_name},\n\nI'm reaching out about {property_name}..."
  email_body <- gsub("\\{first_name\\}", contact_data$first_name, template)
  # Additional substitutions...
  
  return(list(to = email, subject = "Investment Opportunity", body = email_body))
}
```

This approach produces formulaic emails that lack personalization based on the specific context of each property and owner. The template-based approach misses opportunities to craft messages that might resonate more effectively with individual property owners.

## AI-Augmented Workflow with ellmer

The ellmer package transforms this workflow by enabling LLMs to orchestrate the process, making contextual decisions about when and how to use the various API tools.

### Setting Up Tools for the LLM

The first step in the AI-augmented workflow is to register the necessary tools with the LLM:

```r
library(ellmer)

# Create a chat object with your preferred LLM provider
chat <- chat_openai()

# Register scoring tool
register_tool(
  chat,
  name = "score_property",
  description = "Score a property based on its investment potential",
  parameters = list(
    property_data = list(
      type = "object",
      description = "Property data from HUD loans dataset",
      properties = list(
        # Property fields and descriptions
      )
    )
  ),
  fn = function(property_data) {
    # Scoring logic
    return(list(score = score, explanation = explanation))
  }
)

# Register Google Maps Places API tool
register_tool(
  chat,
  name = "search_google_places",
  description = "Search for a business using Google Maps Places API",
  parameters = list(
    company_name = list(type = "string"),
    address = list(type = "string"),
    api_key = list(type = "string")
  ),
  fn = function(company_name, address, api_key) {
    # API call implementation
    return(place_details)
  }
)

# Register Hunter.io email finder tool
register_tool(
  chat,
  name = "find_email",
  description = "Find an email address using Hunter.io API",
  parameters = list(
    first_name = list(type = "string"),
    last_name = list(type = "string"),
    domain = list(type = "string"),
    api_key = list(type = "string")
  ),
  fn = function(first_name, last_name, domain, api_key) {
    # API call implementation
    return(email_details)
  }
)
```

This step defines the capabilities available to the LLM but doesn't dictate exactly how or when they should be used. The LLM will decide based on the context of each property.

### Intelligent Workflow Orchestration

The key difference in the AI-augmented approach is the ability to orchestrate the entire workflow through natural language interactions with the LLM:

```r
process_property <- function(property_row, api_keys, chat) {
  # Extract property and owner data
  property_data <- extract_property_data(property_row)
  owner_data <- extract_owner_data(property_row)
  
  # Ask the LLM to orchestrate the entire process
  result <- chat_conversation(
    chat,
    "I have a property I need to evaluate for our investment outreach campaign.
    Please assess its investment potential, and if promising:
    1. Format the owner's address correctly
    2. Find the company website and domain using Google Maps
    3. Find the owner's email using Hunter.io
    4. Create a personalized outreach email

    Here's the property data:",
    format(property_data),
    "And here's the owner information:",
    format(owner_data)
  )
  
  return(result)
}
```


### Practical Example with "The Anderson" Property

Let's examine how this works with a specific property from the dataset: "The Anderson" in Austin, TX, owned by Paydar Properties. This property has 321 units, a loan amount of \$69.6 million at 2.89% interest, with a completion date of November 2024.

In the traditional workflow, each step would be executed mechanically:

1. The property would be scored based on predefined thresholds
2. If the score exceeds a cutoff, address formatting would proceed
3. The Google Maps API would be called with fixed parameters
4. Hunter.io would be queried with a specific format
5. A template email would be generated with variable substitution

In contrast, the AI-augmented workflow through ellmer enables a more intelligent process:

```r
response <- chat_conversation(
  chat,
  "Let's analyze 'The Anderson' property in Austin. It's a 321-unit development with a $69.6M loan at 2.89% interest, completing in November 2024. The owner is Reza Paydar of Paydar Properties, located in La Jolla, CA. Please evaluate this investment opportunity and if promising, find the owner's email and draft a personalized outreach message."
)
```

The LLM might respond:

"I'll analyze The Anderson property and prepare an outreach strategy if it's promising.

First, let me evaluate its investment potential using the scoring tool:

```
Using score_property tool:
- Property has 321 units (3 points)
- Loan amount of $69.6M (3 points)
- Interest rate of 2.89% (3 points)
- Location rating B+ (2 points)
- Improvement rating A- (2 points)
Total: 13/13 points
```

This is an excellent investment opportunity! The large unit count, substantial loan amount, and favorable interest rate make it particularly attractive. The property is also nearing completion (Nov 2024), which is timely for investment discussions.

Next, I'll format the owner's address:

```
Using format_address tool:
Original: 7855 Herschel Avenue #200, La Jolla, CA, 92037
Formatted: 7855 Herschel Avenue, La Jolla, CA, 92037
```

Now I'll search for company details:

```
Using search_google_places tool:
Found website: https://www.paydarproperties.com
Domain: paydarproperties.com
Phone: (858) 456-9201
```

Let me find the owner's email:

```
Using find_email tool:
Found: reza.paydar@paydarproperties.com
Confidence score: 82
Verification status: valid
```

Based on my research, I've created a personalized outreach email:

Subject: Strategic Investment Opportunity for The Anderson in Austin

Dear Reza,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding your impressive project, The Anderson, located in Austin's growing market.

I noticed your \$69.6M HUD loan at a favorable 2.89% rate is supporting this 321-unit development scheduled for completion in November 2024. Having analyzed numerous HUD-financed multifamily properties across the country, I believe The Anderson presents unique optimization opportunities.

At No Clocks, we specialize in helping developers like you maximize returns on investments through targeted strategies that complement HUD financing structures. Your experience developing high-quality properties in competitive markets aligns perfectly with our approach.

Would you be available for a brief conversation next week to discuss some specific strategies for The Anderson as you approach completion? I have several ideas tailored to the Austin market that might interest you.

Best regards,
Jimmy Briggs

## Key Advantages of the AI-Augmented Workflow

The comparison of these workflows reveals several significant advantages of the AI-augmented approach:

### Contextual Understanding and Adaptive Decision-Making

The traditional workflow applies the same rigid scoring criteria to all properties without considering the unique context of each opportunity. In contrast, the LLM can interpret property data in context, recognizing that factors like location, timing, and market conditions might make a property more valuable than raw numbers suggest.

For example, when evaluating "The Anderson," the LLM would recognize that properties nearing completion present timely opportunities and might weight this factor accordingly, whereas a traditional scoring function would treat all properties with the same completion date equally.

### Intelligent API Orchestration

In the traditional workflow, API calls happen in a predetermined sequence with fixed parameters. The AI-augmented workflow can make intelligent decisions about how to structure API requests based on context. For instance:

When searching for a company's website, the traditional approach might simply concatenate the company name and address, but the LLM might recognize that "Paydar Properties" is likely to be found more easily without the specific address information and adjust its query strategy accordingly.

### Dynamic Error Recovery

Traditional workflows fail when APIs return unexpected results or errors. The AI-augmented workflow can intelligently adapt to these situations:

```
When using search_google_places tool for "Pedcor Companies":
Result: No website found in Google Maps data

Let me try an alternative approach. I'll search for variations of the company name:
Using search_google_places tool with "Pedcor":
Found website: https://www.pedcor.net
Domain: pedcor.net
```


### Personalized Communication

The most significant advantage may be in the creation of outreach emails. Rather than using simple template substitution, the LLM can craft truly personalized messages based on all available information:

Traditional approach:

```
Dear Reza Paydar,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding your property, The Anderson, located at 2711 West Anderson Lane, Austin, TX, 78757.

Based on our analysis of your HUD loan details (loan amount: $69.60 million at 2.89% interest rate), we believe there might be an opportunity to optimize your investment.
```

AI-augmented approach:

```
Dear Reza,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding The Anderson, your impressive 321-unit development in Austin's growing north-central corridor.

With a $69.6M HUD loan at a favorable 2.89% rate and completion anticipated in November, your project is entering a critical phase where strategic decisions could significantly impact long-term returns. Having analyzed the Austin multifamily market extensively, I've identified several approaches that have helped similar developers optimize their HUD-financed properties during the transition from construction to stabilization.
```

The AI-augmented email demonstrates understanding of the specific property, market context, and timing considerations, creating a more compelling and relevant message.

## Implementation Considerations

While the advantages of the AI-augmented workflow are significant, there are important implementation considerations:

### Cost and Performance

LLM-augmented workflows incur additional costs for model usage and may have latency implications. However, these costs may be offset by:

1. Higher response rates from more personalized outreach
2. More efficient prioritization of properties worth pursuing
3. Reduced developer time in maintaining rigid rule systems

### Tool Design Best Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of the AI-augmented workflow:

1. Design tools that handle one specific task rather than complex multi-step processes
2. Include detailed descriptions of tool parameters and expected behavior
3. Return structured data with explanations that the LLM can incorporate into its responses
4. Implement robust error handling within tools while allowing the LLM to decide how to respond to those errors

## Conclusion

The integration of AI via the ellmer package transforms a rigid, rules-based workflow for HUD loan investment opportunities into an intelligent, adaptive process. By allowing an LLM to orchestrate the workflow while leveraging specialized tools for API interactions, the process becomes more effective, resilient, and personalized.

This approach is particularly valuable when working with complex, heterogeneous datasets like the HUD loan information, where context and nuance significantly impact decision-making. By combining the precision of traditional API interactions with the contextual understanding of LLMs, developers can create workflows that are both powerful and adaptable to the specific needs of each property and owner in the dataset.

The example demonstrates how AI augmentation doesn't replace traditional API workflows but enhances them, creating a more intelligent and effective system for identifying and acting on investment opportunities within HUD-financed properties.

The CSPR package currently has several core components:

1. **Configuration** (`config.R`): Handles API keys and configuration settings
2. **Chat** (`chat.R`): Manages ellmer chat initialization and data extraction
3. **Google Maps** (`gmaps.R`): Functions for geocoding and place search
4. **Hunter.io** (`hunter.R`): Email finding functionality
5. **Prompts, Tools, Types** (`prompts.R`, `tools.R`, `types.R`): Definitions for LLM interactions
6. **Utilities** (`utils.R`): Helper functions
7. **Validation** (`validation.R`): Data validation functions

The current implementation follows a traditional approach to API workflows, with separate functions for each step and manual orchestration required.

## Implementation Plan

To enhance the package with AI-augmented workflow features using ellmer, I'll focus on:

1. Improving the LLM integration for intelligent workflow orchestration
2. Enhancing the tool registration system
3. Creating a unified workflow function that leverages the LLM for decision-making
4. Implementing contextual understanding for property evaluation
5. Adding adaptive error handling

Let's implement these changes:

### 1. Enhanced Chat Module (`chat.R`)

# your syntax for ellmer is way off. to register tools you leverage the S7 "register_tool" method, passing it en ellmer::tool() definition:

chat$register_tool(
  ellmer::tool(
    .name = "",
    .description = "",
    .fun = tool_function, # the function to use
    ... # named values with the tool's argument/parameter types
  )
)

You're absolutely right about the syntax for registering tools with ellmer. Thank you for the correction. The ellmer package uses S7 methods and a different approach to tool registration than what I provided. Let me correct this with the proper syntax:

```r
# Correct syntax for registering tools with ellmer
chat$register_tool(
  ellmer::tool(
    .name = "score_property",
    .description = "Score a property based on its investment potential and provide reasoning",
    .fun = score_property_tool,
    property_data = ellmer::schema_object(
      description = "Property data to evaluate",
      properties = list(
        property_name = ellmer::schema_string(description = "Name of the property"),
        loan_amount_mm = ellmer::schema_number(description = "Loan amount in millions"),
        interest_rate = ellmer::schema_number(description = "Interest rate percentage"),
        units = ellmer::schema_integer(description = "Number of units"),
        location_rating = ellmer::schema_string(description = "Location rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
        improvement_rating = ellmer::schema_string(description = "Improvement rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
        completion_date = ellmer::schema_string(description = "Expected completion date")
      )
    )
  )
)

# Example of registering the address formatting tool
chat$register_tool(
  ellmer::tool(
    .name = "format_address",
    .description = "Format an address by removing suite/apt numbers and standardizing format",
    .fun = format_address_tool,
    address = ellmer::schema_string(description = "Raw address to format"),
    city = ellmer::schema_string(description = "City"),
    state = ellmer::schema_string(description = "State (2-letter code)"),
    zip = ellmer::schema_string(description = "ZIP code")
  )
)
```

This is the correct approach using ellmer's S7 methods and schema definitions. Thank you for pointing out this important correction!

# refactor your code to follow my package's practices:

- create a separate function for `score_property`
- create a tool_* function that defines the tool wrapping `score_property` and its arguments types

note: your current code uses invalid functions like schema_object, it would be type_object. however, to properly pass a data.frame or tibble or row to the model via a tool, the following from the ellmer docs (https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/articles/structured-data.html\#advanced-data-types) will need to be taken into account:

"Data frames
If you want to define a data frame like object, you might be tempted to create a definition similar to what R uses: an object (i.e. a named list) containing multiple vectors (i.e. arrays):

type_my_df <- type_object(
name = type_array(items = type_string()),
age = type_array(items = type_integer()),
height = type_array(items = type_number()),
weight = type_array(items = type_number())
)
This however, is not quite right becuase there’s no way to specify that each array should have the same length. Instead you need to turn the data structure “inside out”, and instead create an array of objects:

type_my_df <- type_array(
items = type_object(
name = type_string(),
age = type_integer(),
height = type_number(),
weight = type_number()

If you’re familiar with the terms between row-oriented and column-oriented data frames, this is the same idea. Since most language don’t possess vectorisation like R, row-oriented structures tend to be much more common in the wild."

unless the function to score the property has separate args for each field and not just a data or row arg

Based on your guidance and the ellmer package documentation, I'll refactor the code to create a separate function for `score_property` and a corresponding tool function that follows the correct practices for handling structured data. I'll make sure to use the proper type definitions according to the ellmer documentation.

## 1. Property Scoring Function

First, let's create a standalone function for property scoring:

```r
#' Score a property based on investment potential
#'
#' @param loan_amount_mm Loan amount in millions
#' @param interest_rate Interest rate percentage
#' @param units Number of units in the property
#' @param location_rating Location rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)
#' @param improvement_rating Improvement rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)
#' @param completion_date Expected completion date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
#' @param property_name Optional property name for reference
#' @return A list with score, explanation, recommendation, and max possible score
#' @export
score_property <- function(
    loan_amount_mm,
    interest_rate,
    units,
    location_rating,
    improvement_rating,
    completion_date,
    property_name = NULL
) {
  # Initialize score
  score <- 0
  reasons <- list()
  
  # Loan amount scoring (0-3 points)
  if (loan_amount_mm > 50) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("High loan amount ($", loan_amount_mm, "M) indicates a substantial investment opportunity", sep = ""))
  } else if (loan_amount_mm > 30) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Good loan amount ($", loan_amount_mm, "M) suggests a moderate investment opportunity", sep = ""))
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Lower loan amount ($", loan_amount_mm, "M) may indicate a smaller investment opportunity", sep = ""))
  }
  
  # Interest rate scoring (0-3 points)
  if (interest_rate < 3.0) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Excellent interest rate (", interest_rate, "%) provides favorable financing terms", sep = ""))
  } else if (interest_rate < 3.5) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Good interest rate (", interest_rate, "%) offers reasonable financing terms", sep = ""))
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Higher interest rate (", interest_rate, "%) may impact investment returns", sep = ""))
  }
  
  # Unit count scoring (0-3 points)
  if (units > 250) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Large unit count (", units, " units) provides scale advantages", sep = ""))
  } else if (units > 150) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Good unit count (", units, " units) offers reasonable scale", sep = ""))
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Smaller unit count (", units, " units) may have limited scale advantages", sep = ""))
  }
  
  # Location rating scoring (0-3 points)
  loc_score <- switch(location_rating,
                     "A+" = 3, "A" = 3, 
                     "A-" = 2, "B+" = 2, 
                     "B" = 2, "B-" = 1, 
                     "C+" = 1, "C" = 0, 
                     "C-" = 0, 1)
  score <- score + loc_score
  reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Location rating of ", location_rating, " (", loc_score, " points)", sep = ""))
  
  # Improvement rating scoring (0-3 points)
  imp_score <- switch(improvement_rating,
                     "A+" = 3, "A" = 3, 
                     "A-" = 2, "B+" = 2, 
                     "B" = 2, "B-" = 1, 
                     "C+" = 1, "C" = 0, 
                     "C-" = 0, 1)
  score <- score + imp_score
  reasons <- c(reasons, paste("Improvement rating of ", improvement_rating, " (", imp_score, " points)", sep = ""))
  
  # Completion date scoring (0-3 points)
  completion_date <- as.Date(completion_date)
  current_date <- Sys.Date()
  months_to_completion <- as.numeric(difftime(completion_date, current_date, units = "days")) / 30
  
  if (months_to_completion < 6 && months_to_completion > 0) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Nearing completion (< 6 months) is ideal for timely investment")
  } else if (months_to_completion < 12 && months_to_completion > 0) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Moderate time to completion (6-12 months) provides planning opportunity")
  } else if (months_to_completion > 0) {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Longer time to completion (> 12 months) may delay investment returns")
  } else {
    # Already completed
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Property already completed and potentially operational")
  }
  
  # Combine reasons into a single explanation
  explanation <- paste(reasons, collapse = ". ")
  
  # Determine recommendation based on score (max possible score is 18)
  recommendation <- if (score >= 14) {
    "High Priority: Excellent investment opportunity, proceed with outreach immediately"
  } else if (score >= 10) {
    "Medium Priority: Good investment opportunity, proceed with outreach"
  } else {
    "Low Priority: Limited investment opportunity, consider alternatives first"
  }
  
  # Add property name to the output if provided
  property_info <- if (!is.null(property_name)) {
    paste("Property:", property_name)
  } else {
    "Property assessment"
  }
  
  return(list(
    score = score,
    explanation = explanation,
    recommendation = recommendation,
    max_possible_score = 18,
    property_info = property_info
  ))
}
```


## 2. Tool Function for Property Scoring

Now, let's create the tool function that will be used with ellmer:

```r
#' Create a tool for scoring property investment potential
#'
#' This function creates an ellmer tool that can be registered with a chat
#' to evaluate property investment potential.
#'
#' @return An ellmer tool object
#' @export
tool_score_property <- function() {
  ellmer::tool(
    .name = "score_property",
    .description = "Score a property based on its investment potential and provide reasoning",
    .fun = function(loan_amount_mm, interest_rate, units, location_rating, 
                   improvement_rating, completion_date, property_name = NULL) {
      score_property(
        loan_amount_mm = loan_amount_mm,
        interest_rate = interest_rate,
        units = units,
        location_rating = location_rating,
        improvement_rating = improvement_rating,
        completion_date = completion_date,
        property_name = property_name
      )
    },
    loan_amount_mm = ellmer::type_number(description = "Loan amount in millions"),
    interest_rate = ellmer::type_number(description = "Interest rate percentage"),
    units = ellmer::type_integer(description = "Number of units in the property"),
    location_rating = ellmer::type_string(description = "Location rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
    improvement_rating = ellmer::type_string(description = "Improvement rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
    completion_date = ellmer::type_string(description = "Expected completion date in YYYY-MM-DD format"),
    property_name = ellmer::type_string(description = "Name of the property", required = FALSE)
  )
}
```


## 3. Example Usage with the Chat

Here's how you would register and use this tool with an ellmer chat:

```r
#' Initialize an AI chat with property investment analysis tools
#'
#' @param api_key OpenAI API key (optional if set in environment)
#' @param model Model to use (default: "gpt-4o")
#' @return A chat object with registered tools
#' @export
initialize_investment_chat <- function(api_key = NULL, model = "gpt-4o") {
  # Initialize chat
  chat <- ellmer::chat_openai(
    api_key = api_key %||% Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model = model
  )
  
  # Register property scoring tool
  chat$register_tool(tool_score_property())
  
  # Register other tools as needed...
  
  return(chat)
}

#' Process a property record to evaluate investment potential
#'
#' @param property_row A row from the HUD loans dataset
#' @param chat An initialized ellmer chat object
#' @return The chat response with investment evaluation
#' @export
evaluate_property_investment <- function(property_row, chat) {
  # Extract property data from the row
  property_data <- list(
    property_name = property_row$`Property Name`,
    loan_amount_mm = property_row$`Loan Amount (MM)`,
    interest_rate = property_row$`Interest Rate %`,
    units = property_row$Units,
    location_rating = property_row$`Loc. Rating`,
    improvement_rating = property_row$`Impr. Rating`,
    completion_date = property_row$`Completion Date`
  )
  
  # Create prompt for the AI
  prompt <- paste0(
    "Please evaluate this property as an investment opportunity:\n\n",
    "Property: ", property_data$property_name, "\n",
    "Location: ", property_row$City, ", ", property_row$State, "\n",
    "Units: ", property_data$units, "\n",
    "Loan Amount: $", property_data$loan_amount_mm, " million\n",
    "Interest Rate: ", property_data$interest_rate, "%\n",
    "Location Rating: ", property_data$location_rating, "\n",
    "Improvement Rating: ", property_data$improvement_rating, "\n",
    "Completion Date: ", property_data$completion_date, "\n\n",
    "Score this property's investment potential and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning."
  )
  
  # Get AI response
  response <- chat$chat(prompt)
  
  return(response)
}
```


## 4. Alternative Approach for Handling Data Frame Rows

If you prefer to pass an entire row or data structure to the tool rather than individual parameters, here's how you could implement that following the ellmer documentation for structured data:

```r
#' Create a tool for scoring property investment potential using a structured object
#'
#' @return An ellmer tool object
#' @export
tool_score_property_structured <- function() {
  ellmer::tool(
    .name = "score_property_structured",
    .description = "Score a property based on its investment potential using structured property data",
    .fun = function(property) {
      score_property(
        loan_amount_mm = property$loan_amount_mm,
        interest_rate = property$interest_rate,
        units = property$units,
        location_rating = property$location_rating,
        improvement_rating = property$improvement_rating,
        completion_date = property$completion_date,
        property_name = property$property_name
      )
    },
    property = ellmer::type_object(
      description = "Property data to evaluate",
      properties = list(
        property_name = ellmer::type_string(description = "Name of the property"),
        loan_amount_mm = ellmer::type_number(description = "Loan amount in millions"),
        interest_rate = ellmer::type_number(description = "Interest rate percentage"),
        units = ellmer::type_integer(description = "Number of units"),
        location_rating = ellmer::type_string(description = "Location rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
        improvement_rating = ellmer::type_string(description = "Improvement rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
        completion_date = ellmer::type_string(description = "Expected completion date")
      )
    )
  )
}
```

This approach follows the ellmer documentation for handling structured data while maintaining the separation between the core scoring logic and the tool interface.

# isnt the point of leveraging AI here to avoid this manual scoring process? provide me the code to score the properties using ellmer

You're absolutely right! The point of leveraging AI with ellmer is to avoid manual scoring processes and create more intelligent, adaptive workflows. Let me provide you with the code to score properties using ellmer, following the package's practices.

First, let's create a function to score properties, then a tool definition that wraps it:

```r
#' Score a property based on investment potential
#'
#' @param property_data A list containing property information
#' @return A list with score, explanation, recommendation, and max possible score
#' @export
score_property <- function(property_data) {
  # Initialize score and reasons
  score <- 0
  reasons <- character()
  
  # Extract property data with appropriate defaults
  loan_amount_mm <- property_data$loan_amount_mm %||% 0
  interest_rate <- property_data$interest_rate %||% 0
  units <- property_data$units %||% 0
  location_rating <- property_data$location_rating %||% "C"
  improvement_rating <- property_data$improvement_rating %||% "C"
  completion_date <- property_data$completion_date %||% Sys.Date()
  property_name <- property_data$property_name %||% "Unknown Property"
  
  # Loan amount scoring (0-3 points)
  if (loan_amount_mm > 50) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("High loan amount ($", loan_amount_mm, "M) indicates a substantial investment opportunity"))
  } else if (loan_amount_mm > 30) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Good loan amount ($", loan_amount_mm, "M) suggests a moderate investment opportunity"))
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Lower loan amount ($", loan_amount_mm, "M) may indicate a smaller investment opportunity"))
  }
  
  # Interest rate scoring (0-3 points)
  if (interest_rate < 3.0) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Excellent interest rate (", interest_rate, "%) provides favorable financing terms"))
  } else if (interest_rate < 3.5) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Good interest rate (", interest_rate, "%) offers reasonable financing terms"))
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Higher interest rate (", interest_rate, "%) may impact investment returns"))
  }
  
  # Unit count scoring (0-3 points)
  if (units > 250) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Large unit count (", units, " units) provides scale advantages"))
  } else if (units > 150) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Good unit count (", units, " units) offers reasonable scale"))
  } else {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Smaller unit count (", units, " units) may have limited scale advantages"))
  }
  
  # Location rating scoring (0-3 points)
  loc_score <- switch(
    substr(location_rating, 1, 1),
    "A" = if (grepl("\\+", location_rating)) 3 else if (grepl("-", location_rating)) 2 else 3,
    "B" = if (grepl("\\+", location_rating)) 2 else if (grepl("-", location_rating)) 1 else 2,
    "C" = if (grepl("\\+", location_rating)) 1 else 0,
    1
  )
  score <- score + loc_score
  reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Location rating of ", location_rating, " (", loc_score, " points)"))
  
  # Improvement rating scoring (0-3 points)
  imp_score <- switch(
    substr(improvement_rating, 1, 1),
    "A" = if (grepl("\\+", improvement_rating)) 3 else if (grepl("-", improvement_rating)) 2 else 3,
    "B" = if (grepl("\\+", improvement_rating)) 2 else if (grepl("-", improvement_rating)) 1 else 2,
    "C" = if (grepl("\\+", improvement_rating)) 1 else 0,
    1
  )
  score <- score + imp_score
  reasons <- c(reasons, paste0("Improvement rating of ", improvement_rating, " (", imp_score, " points)"))
  
  # Completion date scoring (0-3 points)
  completion_date <- as.Date(completion_date)
  current_date <- Sys.Date()
  months_to_completion <- as.numeric(difftime(completion_date, current_date, units = "days")) / 30
  
  if (months_to_completion < 6 && months_to_completion > 0) {
    score <- score + 3
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Nearing completion (< 6 months) is ideal for timely investment")
  } else if (months_to_completion < 12 && months_to_completion > 0) {
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Moderate time to completion (6-12 months) provides planning opportunity")
  } else if (months_to_completion > 0) {
    score <- score + 1
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Longer time to completion (> 12 months) may delay investment returns")
  } else {
    # Already completed
    score <- score + 2
    reasons <- c(reasons, "Property already completed and potentially operational")
  }
  
  # Combine reasons into a single explanation
  explanation <- paste(reasons, collapse = ". ")
  
  # Determine recommendation based on score (max possible score is 18)
  recommendation <- if (score >= 14) {
    "High Priority: Excellent investment opportunity, proceed with outreach immediately"
  } else if (score >= 10) {
    "Medium Priority: Good investment opportunity, proceed with outreach"
  } else {
    "Low Priority: Limited investment opportunity, consider alternatives first"
  }
  
  return(list(
    score = score,
    explanation = explanation,
    recommendation = recommendation,
    max_possible_score = 18,
    property_name = property_name
  ))
}

#' Create a tool for scoring property investment potential
#'
#' This function creates an ellmer tool that can be registered with a chat
#' to evaluate property investment potential.
#'
#' @return An ellmer tool object
#' @export
tool_score_property <- function() {
  ellmer::tool(
    .name = "score_property",
    .description = "Score a property based on its investment potential and provide reasoning",
    .fun = score_property,
    property_data = ellmer::type_object(
      description = "Property data to evaluate",
      properties = list(
        property_name = ellmer::type_string(description = "Name of the property"),
        loan_amount_mm = ellmer::type_number(description = "Loan amount in millions"),
        interest_rate = ellmer::type_number(description = "Interest rate percentage"),
        units = ellmer::type_integer(description = "Number of units"),
        location_rating = ellmer::type_string(description = "Location rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
        improvement_rating = ellmer::type_string(description = "Improvement rating (A+, A, A-, etc.)"),
        completion_date = ellmer::type_string(description = "Expected completion date")
      )
    )
  )
}
```

Now, let's create a function to process a property record with the LLM:

```r
#' Process a property record to evaluate investment potential using AI
#'
#' @param property_row A row from the HUD loans dataset
#' @param chat An initialized ellmer chat object with registered tools
#' @return The chat response with investment evaluation
#' @export
evaluate_property_investment <- function(property_row, chat = NULL) {
  if (is.null(chat)) {
    chat <- initialize_investment_chat()
  }
  
  # Create prompt for the AI
  prompt <- paste0(
    "Please evaluate this property as an investment opportunity:\n\n",
    "Property: ", property_row$`Property Name`, "\n",
    "Location: ", property_row$City, ", ", property_row$State, "\n",
    "Units: ", property_row$Units, "\n",
    "Loan Amount: $", property_row$`Loan Amount (MM)`, " million\n",
    "Interest Rate: ", property_row$`Interest Rate %`, "%\n",
    "Location Rating: ", property_row$`Loc. Rating`, "\n",
    "Improvement Rating: ", property_row$`Impr. Rating`, "\n",
    "Completion Date: ", property_row$`Completion Date`, "\n\n",
    "Score this property's investment potential using the score_property tool and provide a detailed analysis. Then determine if we should proceed with finding the owner's email address for outreach."
  )
  
  # Get AI response
  response <- chat$chat(prompt)
  
  return(response)
}

#' Initialize an AI chat with property investment analysis tools
#'
#' @param api_key OpenAI API key (optional if set in environment)
#' @param model Model to use (default: "gpt-4o")
#' @return A chat object with registered tools
#' @export
initialize_investment_chat <- function(api_key = NULL, model = "gpt-4o") {
  # Initialize chat
  chat <- ellmer::chat_openai(
    api_key = api_key %||% Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model = model
  )
  
  # Register property scoring tool
  chat$register_tool(tool_score_property())
  
  # Register other tools as needed...
  
  return(chat)
}
```

To process multiple properties and rank them in a batch:

```r
#' Process multiple properties and rank them by investment potential
#'
#' @param properties A data frame of HUD loan properties
#' @param top_n Number of top properties to return (default: 10)
#' @return A data frame of ranked properties with scores and recommendations
#' @export
rank_investment_properties <- function(properties, top_n = 10) {
  # Initialize chat once for all properties
  chat <- initialize_investment_chat()
  
  # Create a function to extract scores from responses
  extract_score <- function(response) {
    # Try to extract structured data
    tryCatch({
      # Look for tool call results in the response
      tool_results <- response$get_tool_results()
      if (length(tool_results) > 0 && !is.null(tool_results[[^6_1]]$score)) {
        return(tool_results[[^6_1]])
      }
      
      # Fallback to regex extraction if tool results not found
      score_pattern <- "score\\s*=\\s*(\\d+)"
      score_match <- regexpr(score_pattern, response$get_text(), ignore.case = TRUE)
      if (score_match > 0) {
        score <- as.numeric(regmatches(response$get_text(), score_match))
        return(list(score = score))
      }
      
      return(list(score = NA))
    }, error = function(e) {
      return(list(score = NA))
    })
  }
  
  # Process properties in batches to avoid rate limits
  batch_size <- 5
  num_properties <- nrow(properties)
  results <- list()
  
  for (i in seq(1, num_properties, by = batch_size)) {
    end_idx <- min(i + batch_size - 1, num_properties)
    batch <- properties[i:end_idx, ]
    
    for (j in 1:nrow(batch)) {
      cat("Processing property", i + j - 1, "of", num_properties, ":", batch$`Property Name`[j], "\n")
      response <- evaluate_property_investment(batch[j, ], chat)
      score_data <- extract_score(response)
      
      results[[i + j - 1]] <- list(
        property_name = batch$`Property Name`[j],
        city = batch$City[j],
        state = batch$State[j],
        units = batch$Units[j],
        loan_amount_mm = batch$`Loan Amount (MM)`[j],
        interest_rate = batch$`Interest Rate %`[j],
        completion_date = batch$`Completion Date`[j],
        score = score_data$score,
        recommendation = score_data$recommendation,
        explanation = score_data$explanation,
        owner_name = paste(batch$`Owner Contact First Name`[j], batch$`Owner Contact Last Name`[j]),
        owner_company = batch$Owner[j],
        owner_email = batch$`Owner Contact Email`[j]
      )
      
      # Pause briefly to avoid rate limits
      Sys.sleep(0.5)
    }
    
    # Longer pause between batches
    Sys.sleep(2)
  }
  
  # Convert results to data frame

      city = x$city,
      state = x$state,
      units = x$units,
      loan_amount_mm = x$loan_amount_mm,
      interest_rate = x$interest_rate,
      completion_date = x$completion_date,
      score = x$score,
      recommendation = x$recommendation,
      owner_name = x$owner_name,
      owner_company = x$owner_company,
      owner_email = x$owner_email,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
  }))
  
  # Sort by score and return top_n
  ranked_properties <- results_df[order(results_df$score, decreasing = TRUE), ]
  return(head(ranked_properties, top_n))
}
```

This approach leverages ellmer to:

1. Create a tool that scores properties based on multiple factors
2. Let the AI decide when to use the tool and how to interpret its results
3. Provide context-aware recommendations rather than just numerical scores
4. Automate the decision about whether to proceed with email enrichment

The key advantage here is that the AI can consider nuanced factors that might not be captured in a rigid scoring algorithm. For example, it might recognize that a property with a slightly lower score but in a rapidly developing area represents a better opportunity than one with a higher score but in a market showing signs of saturation.

You could further enhance this by adding more tools for the AI to use, such as market analysis tools or tools that fetch additional property data from external sources.

# that still is the exact same - its a manual approach to score the property and does not leverage AI to perform the scoring for us.... please redo

You're absolutely right - I apologize for missing the point. The whole purpose of using ellmer with AI is to avoid manual scoring algorithms and leverage the AI's ability to analyze and score properties intelligently. Let me provide the correct approach that uses AI for property scoring:

## AI-Driven Property Scoring with ellmer

Instead of creating a manual scoring function, we should design a workflow that allows the LLM to evaluate properties directly. Here's how to implement this:

```r
#' Initialize an investment analysis chat with necessary tools
#'
#' @param api_key OpenAI API key (optional if set in environment)
#' @param model Model to use (default: "gpt-4o")
#' @return A chat object with registered tools
#' @export
initialize_investment_chat <- function(api_key = NULL, model = "gpt-4o") {
  # Initialize chat
  chat <- ellmer::chat_openai(
    api_key = api_key %||% Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model = model
  )
  
  # Register Google Maps place search tool
  chat$register_tool(
    ellmer::tool(
      .name = "search_google_places",
      .description = "Search for business details using Google Maps Places API",
      .fun = function(company_name, formatted_address) {
        # Get API key from environment
        api_key <- get_gmaps_api_key()
        
        # Call the search_places function from gmaps.R
        result <- tryCatch({
          place_details <- search_places(company_name, formatted_address, api_key)
          
          # Extract domain from website if available
          domain <- NULL
          if (!is.null(place_details$website)) {
            domain <- extract_domain(place_details$website)
          }
          
          list(

            status = "success"
          )
        }, error = function(e) {
          # Try alternative search with just company name if the first attempt fails
          tryCatch({
            place_details <- search_places(company_name, NULL, api_key)
            
            # Extract domain from website if available
            domain <- NULL
            if (!is.null(place_details$website)) {
              domain <- extract_domain(place_details$website)
            }
            
            list(
              place_id = place_details$place_id,

      owner_email = x$owner_email,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
  }))
  
  # Sort by score and return top_n
  ranked_properties <- results_df[order(results_df$score, decreasing = TRUE), ]
  return(head(ranked_properties, top_n))
}
```

This approach leverages the LLM to:

1. **Analyze properties holistically**: Instead of using a rigid scoring algorithm with predefined weights, the AI considers all factors in context and can identify nuanced opportunities.
2. **Adapt to changing market conditions**: Since the AI is aware of the current date, it can factor in timing considerations like how close a property is to completion.
3. **Provide detailed reasoning**: The AI explains why a property is a good or poor investment opportunity, which helps stakeholders understand the recommendations.
4. **Make intelligent decisions about email enrichment**: Rather than enriching all records, the AI only proceeds with email finding for promising opportunities.
5. **Generate personalized outreach messages**: For high-scoring properties, the AI can draft customized emails that reference specific aspects of the property that make it attractive.

The key difference is that we're not providing the AI with a predefined scoring algorithm - we're letting it use its own judgment based on real estate investment principles to evaluate each property. This allows for more nuanced analysis that can adapt to different property types, markets, and economic conditions without requiring code changes.

The error you're encountering is a timeout when trying to communicate with the OpenAI API. This is a common issue that can occur for several reasons:

1. Network connectivity problems
2. OpenAI API service disruptions
3. Request taking too long to complete (large prompts or complex tasks)
4. Rate limiting or quota issues

Here are some solutions to address this problem in your CSPR package:

## 1. Increase the Timeout Setting

The most direct solution is to increase the timeout setting in your httr2 request. You can modify your chat initialization function to include a longer timeout:

```r
# In chat.R or wherever you initialize the OpenAI chat
initialize_investment_chat <- function(api_key = NULL, model = "gpt-4o", timeout = 60) {
  # Initialize chat with increased timeout
  chat <- ellmer::chat_openai(
    api_key = api_key %||% Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model = model,
    options = list(
      timeout = timeout  # Set timeout in seconds (default is usually 10)
    )
  )
  
  # Register tools...
  
  return(chat)
}
```

The ellmer package should pass these options to the underlying httr2 request. If it doesn't, you might need to modify the package or implement a custom request function.

## 2. Implement Retry Logic

Add retry logic to handle transient failures:

```r
property_investment_with_retry <- function(property_row, chat = NULL, max_retries = 3, 
                                          backoff = 2, timeout = 60) {
  if (is.null(chat)) {
    chat <- initialize_investment_chat(timeout = timeout)
  }
  
  attempt <- 1
  while (attempt <= max_retries) {
    tryCatch({
      prompt <- property_investment_prompt(property_row)
      return(chat$chat(prompt))
    }, error = function(e) {
      if (attempt == max_retries) {
        stop("Failed after ", max_retries, " attempts: ", e$message)
      }
      
      wait_time <- backoff^attempt
      message("API request failed (attempt ", attempt, "/", max_retries, 
              "). Retrying in ", wait_time, " seconds...")
      Sys.sleep(wait_time)
      attempt <<- attempt + 1
    })
  }
}
```


## 3. Reduce Prompt Size

If your prompts are very large, they might be causing the timeout. Consider reducing the amount of data sent in each request:

```r
property_investment_prompt <- function(property_row) {
  # Create a more concise prompt
  prompt <- paste0(
    "Analyze this property as an investment opportunity:\n\n",
    "Property: ", property_row$`Property Name`, "\n",
    "Location: ", property_row$City, ", ", property_row$State, "\n",
    "Units: ", property_row$Units, "\n",
    "Loan: $", property_row$`Loan Amount (MM)`, "M at ", property_row$`Interest Rate %`, "%\n",
    "Ratings: Location ", property_row$`Loc. Rating`, ", Improvement ", property_row$`Impr. Rating`, "\n",
    "Completion: ", property_row$`Completion Date`, "\n\n",
    "Score this property (1-10) and determine if we should find the owner's email for outreach."
  )
  
  return(prompt)
}
```


## 4. Split the Process into Smaller Steps

Instead of asking the API to do everything at once, break it into smaller steps:

```r
process_property_in_steps <- function(property_row, chat = NULL) {
  if (is.null(chat)) {
    chat <- initialize_investment_chat(timeout = 60)
  }
  
  # Step 1: Initial scoring
  scoring_prompt <- paste0(
    "Score this property (1-10):\n",
    "Property: ", property_row$`Property Name`, "\n",
    "Location: ", property_row$City, ", ", property_row$State, "\n",
    "Units: ", property_row$Units, "\n",
    "Loan: $", property_row$`Loan Amount (MM)`, "M at ", property_row$`Interest Rate %`, "%"
  )
  
  score_response <- tryCatch({
    chat$chat(scoring_prompt)
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("Scoring failed: ", e$message)
    return(NULL)
  })
  
  # Extract score and decide whether to continue
  # (Implement logic to parse score from response)
  
  # If score is high enough, proceed with email finding
  if (!is.null(score_response) && parsed_score > 7) {
    # Step 2: Email finding logic
    # ...
  }
  
  return(list(score = score_response, email = email_response))
}
```


## 5. Check Network and API Status

Before making requests, you could implement a function to check if the OpenAI API is accessible:

```r
check_openai_status <- function() {
  tryCatch({
    req <- httr2::request("https://api.openai.com/v1/models")
    resp <- httr2::req_perform(req, timeout_seconds = 5)
    return(httr2::resp_status(resp) < 400)
  }, error = function(e) {
    message("OpenAI API appears to be unreachable: ", e$message)
    return(FALSE)
  })
}
```


## 6. Implement Asynchronous Processing

For batch processing, consider implementing asynchronous requests to avoid blocking:

```r
process_properties_async <- function(properties, top_n = 10) {
  # Use the promises or future package for async processing
  library(future)
  library(promises)
  
  plan(multisession)
  
  results <- list()
  for (i in 1:nrow(properties)) {
    results[[i]] <- future_promise({
      property_investment_with_retry(properties[i, ])
    })
  }
  
  # Collect results
  # ...
}
```


## Implementation in Your Package

To implement these solutions in your CSPR package, you'll need to modify the relevant functions. Based on the error message, it looks like you're using the `chat$chat()` method directly. You should wrap this call with the retry logic and timeout settings as shown above.

The most straightforward solution is to increase the timeout and implement retry logic, as these changes require minimal modifications to your existing code.

Remember to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users when API calls fail, especially in a production environment.

user_prompt <- property_investment_prompt(property_row)
resp <- chat\$chat(user_prompt)
cat(resp)

where:

and the output was:

> cat(resp)
> To evaluate the Huntington Gardens property as a potential investment opportunity, let’s analyze the factors one by one:

1. **Loan Amount and Interest Rate Compared to Market Standards:**
    - The loan amount is approximately \$22.753 million with an interest rate of 3.1% fixed. This rate is quite favorable, given that it's a HUD-backed loan, which typically offers advantageous terms. The low-interest rate signifies cost-effective long-term financing.
2. **Number of Units:**
    - With 180 units, this property provides a significant potential for rental income. The scale of operations can be favorable for both current income and opportunities for renovation-led growth, making it an attractive acquisition target.
3. **Property's Location and Improvement Ratings:**
    - The location rating of B in Orange County suggests it is in a moderately attractive area. This county is well-known for its desirability as a place to live, which generally supports tenant demand.
    - The improvement rating of C indicates there might be some need for updates, which could offer a potential upside if those improvements can enhance rental income or reduce operating expenses.
4. **Completion Timeline and Market Timing:**
    - The property was completed in 1980, making it over 40 years old. This age may necessitate updating building systems or interiors, but it’s also a common scenario for multifamily investments.
    - Loan origination in 2012 and maturity in 2047 offers a stable horizon, but it’s essential to consider mid-point refinancing or exit strategies due to the property's age.
5. **Property's Sale Price and Loan Origination/Maturity Dates:**
    - With no current sale date or price provided, it’s unclear how the current value compares to historical investment. The long loan duration provides certainty in financing costs.
6. **Owner's Contact Information and Company Details:**
    - Owned by LOMCO, with Stephen Doty as the contact person. The owner is likely seasoned in property management, which can mean the property is well-managed, but could also be an obstacle to negotiation if they are satisfied with current performance.
7. **Additional Notes on Loan Terms or Property Details:**
    - Use of a HUD 223(f) loan provides confidence of lower risk due to federal backing. The fixed interest rate and long amortization period further enhance stability.

**Numerical Score (1-10):** 7.5/10

- The combination of stable financing, potential for improvement, and a decent location supports this score. The financial leverage with favorable terms is a significant plus.

**Recommendation:**
Given the competitive interest rate, stable financing, and potential for renovation-led growth in a desirable market, it would be prudent to explore further. Tracking down the contact email for Stephen Doty or the company LOMCO would be beneficial to opening a dialogue regarding potential transactions or partnerships.

**Conclusion:**
While there is uncertainty regarding immediate sale potential, the investment's stable financing and potential upsides warrant further investigation. Checking viability for necessary updates and verifying current market rents may create further clarity.

Shall I proceed with retrieving the email addresses for outreach to Stephen Doty or LOMCO?

now I need to create a type definition function type_* and chat_extract_* function for taking these results and parsing into a structured output with the score and the recommendation along with the textual response, etc.

Based on your request, I'll help you create type definitions and extraction functions for parsing the AI's property investment analysis into structured output. Here's how to implement these components:

## 1. Type Definition Function

First, let's create a type definition for the property investment analysis:

```r
#' Property Investment Analysis Type Definition
#'
#' @description
#' Define the structure for property investment analysis results.
#'
#' @return An ellmer type definition for property investment analysis
#' @export
type_property_investment_analysis <- function() {
  ellmer::type_object(
    description = "Property investment analysis results",
    properties = list(
      property_name = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Name of the property analyzed"
      ),
      numerical_score = ellmer::type_number(
        description = "Numerical score from 1-10 indicating investment potential"
      ),
      recommendation = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Overall recommendation about pursuing the investment opportunity"
      ),
      proceed_with_email = ellmer::type_boolean(
        description = "Whether to proceed with finding owner email for outreach"
      ),
      loan_analysis = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Analysis of loan amount and interest rate"
      ),
      units_analysis = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Analysis of the property's unit count and scale"
      ),
      location_analysis = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Analysis of the property's location and ratings"
      ),
      timeline_analysis = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Analysis of completion timeline and market timing"
      ),
      additional_notes = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "Any additional notes or observations",
        required = FALSE
      ),
      full_analysis = ellmer::type_string(
        description = "The complete textual analysis"
      )
    ),
    required = c(
      "property_name", "numerical_score", "recommendation", 
      "proceed_with_email", "full_analysis"
    )
  )
}
```


## 2. Chat Extraction Function

Next, let's create a function to extract the structured data from the chat response:

```r
#' Extract Property Investment Analysis
#'
#' @description
#' Extract structured property investment analysis data from a chat response.
#'
#' @param response An ellmer chat response object
#' @param property_name The name of the property being analyzed
#'
#' @return A list containing the structured property investment analysis
#' @export
#'
#' @importFrom ellmer extract
chat_extract_property_analysis <- function(response, property_name) {
  # Define the schema for extraction
  schema <- type_property_investment_analysis()
  
  # Get the full text response
  full_text <- response$get_text()
  
  # Extract the numerical score using regex
  score_pattern <- "Numerical Score \\(1-10\\):\\s*([0-9](\\.\\d)?|10)\\s*/10"
  score_match <- regexpr(score_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  score <- NA
  if (score_match > 0) {
    score_text <- regmatches(full_text, score_match)
    score <- as.numeric(gsub(".*:\\s*([0-9](\\.\\d)?|10).*", "\\1", score_text))
  }
  
  # Extract the recommendation
  recommendation_pattern <- "Recommendation:\\s*(.*?)\\s*(?=Conclusion:|$)"
  recommendation_match <- regexpr(recommendation_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  recommendation <- ""
  if (recommendation_match > 0) {
    recommendation_text <- regmatches(full_text, recommendation_match)
    recommendation <- gsub("Recommendation:\\s*", "", recommendation_text)
    recommendation <- trimws(recommendation)
  }
  
  # Determine if we should proceed with email finding
  proceed_with_email <- grepl(
    "proceed with .*(email|contact|outreach)|further (investigation|exploration|inquiry)",
    full_text, 
    ignore.case = TRUE
  )
  
  # Extract loan analysis
  loan_pattern <- "Loan Amount and Interest Rate.*?:(.+?)(?=\\d+\\.\\s|$)"
  loan_match <- regexpr(loan_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  loan_analysis <- ""
  if (loan_match > 0) {
    loan_text <- regmatches(full_text, loan_match)
    loan_analysis <- gsub("Loan Amount and Interest Rate.*?:", "", loan_text)
    loan_analysis <- trimws(loan_analysis)
  }
  
  # Extract units analysis
  units_pattern <- "Number of Units.*?:(.+?)(?=\\d+\\.\\s|$)"
  units_match <- regexpr(units_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  units_analysis <- ""
  if (units_match > 0) {
    units_text <- regmatches(full_text, units_match)
    units_analysis <- gsub("Number of Units.*?:", "", units_text)
    units_analysis <- trimws(units_analysis)
  }
  
  # Extract location analysis
  location_pattern <- "Location (?:and|&) (Improvement )?Ratings.*?:(.+?)(?=\\d+\\.\\s|$)"
  location_match <- regexpr(location_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  location_analysis <- ""
  if (location_match > 0) {
    location_text <- regmatches(full_text, location_match)
    location_analysis <- gsub("Location (?:and|&) (Improvement )?Ratings.*?:", "", location_text)
    location_analysis <- trimws(location_analysis)
  }
  
  # Extract timeline analysis
  timeline_pattern <- "Completion Timeline.*?:(.+?)(?=\\d+\\.\\s|$)"
  timeline_match <- regexpr(timeline_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  timeline_analysis <- ""
  if (timeline_match > 0) {
    timeline_text <- regmatches(full_text, timeline_match)
    timeline_analysis <- gsub("Completion Timeline.*?:", "", timeline_text)
    timeline_analysis <- trimws(timeline_analysis)
  }
  
  # Extract additional notes
  notes_pattern <- "Additional Notes.*?:(.+?)(?=Numerical Score|$)"
  notes_match <- regexpr(notes_pattern, full_text, perl = TRUE)
  additional_notes <- ""
  if (notes_match > 0) {
    notes_text <- regmatches(full_text, notes_match)
    additional_notes <- gsub("Additional Notes.*?:", "", notes_text)
    additional_notes <- trimws(additional_notes)
  }
  
  # Create the structured analysis
  analysis <- list(
    property_name = property_name,
    numerical_score = score,
    recommendation = recommendation,
    proceed_with_email = proceed_with_email,
    loan_analysis = loan_analysis,
    units_analysis = units_analysis,
    location_analysis = location_analysis,
    timeline_analysis = timeline_analysis,
    additional_notes = additional_notes,
    full_analysis = full_text
  )
  
  return(analysis)
}
```


## 3. Usage Example

Here's how you would use these functions in your workflow:

```r
#' Analyze Property Investment
#'
#' @description
#' Analyze a property for investment potential and extract structured results.
#'
#' @param property_row A data frame row containing property details
#' @param chat An initialized ellmer chat object (optional)
#'
#' @return A list containing structured property investment analysis
#' @export
analyze_property_investment <- function(property_row, chat = NULL) {
  if (is.null(chat)) {
    chat <- initialize_chat(echo = "none")
  }
  
  # Get property name
  property_name <- property_row$`Property Name`
  
  # Generate the prompt and get response
  user_prompt <- property_investment_prompt(property_row)
  
  # Add retry logic to handle timeout issues
  max_retries <- 3
  attempt <- 1
  
  while (attempt <= max_retries) {
    tryCatch({
      resp <- chat$chat(user_prompt)
      
      # Extract structured analysis
      analysis <- chat_extract_property_analysis(resp, property_name)
      
      return(list(
        response = resp,
        analysis = analysis
      ))
    }, error = function(e) {
      if (attempt == max_retries) {
        stop("Failed after ", max_retries, " attempts: ", e$message)
      }
      
      wait_time <- 2^attempt
      message("API request failed (attempt ", attempt, "/", max_retries, 
              "). Retrying in ", wait_time, " seconds...")
      Sys.sleep(wait_time)
      attempt <<- attempt + 1
    })
  }
}
```


## 4. Alternative Using ellmer's extract Function

If you want to leverage ellmer's built-in extraction capabilities more directly:

```r
#' Extract Property Investment Analysis Using ellmer
#'
#' @description
#' Extract structured property investment analysis data using ellmer's extract function.
#'
#' @param response An ellmer chat response object
#' @param property_name The name of the property being analyzed
#'
#' @return A list containing the structured property investment analysis
#' @export
#'
#' @importFrom ellmer extract
chat_extract_property_analysis_v2 <- function(response, property_name) {
  # Define the extraction schema
  schema <- type_property_investment_analysis()
  
  # Get the full text response
  full_text <- response$get_text()
  
  # Create a prompt for extraction
  extraction_prompt <- paste0(
    "Extract the following information from the property investment analysis:\n\n",
    "1. The numerical score (a number between 1 and 10)\n",
    "2. The recommendation about whether to pursue this investment\n",
    "3. Whether we should proceed with finding the owner's email\n",
    "4. Analysis of the loan amount and interest rate\n",
    "5. Analysis of the property's unit count\n",
    "6. Analysis of the property's location and ratings\n",
    "7. Analysis of the completion timeline\n",
    "8. Any additional notes\n\n",
    "Here is the analysis:\n\n",
    full_text
  )
  
  # Extract structured data
  extracted <- ellmer::extract(
    extraction_prompt,
    schema = schema,
    property_name = property_name,
    full_analysis = full_text
  )
  
  return(extracted)
}
```

This approach uses ellmer's extract function to have the LLM itself parse the analysis into structured data, which can be more accurate for complex text but requires an additional API call.

These functions should help you parse the AI's property investment analysis into structured data that you can easily work with in your R code. The type definition ensures consistent structure, and the extraction functions provide flexibility in how you obtain the structured data.
