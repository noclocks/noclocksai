# Repository Instructions

This document provides guidance for analyzing the `{{name}}` repository. The instructions are designed to help AI systems and developers understand the structure, purpose, and key components of this project.

## Overview

The `{{name}}` repository contains the source code and resources for an R package. The project is structured to follow standard R package conventions, with additional directories for development and testing.

## Key Directories

- **R/**: Contains R scripts defining the core functionality of the package.
- **inst/**: Contains additional files to be installed with the package.
- **man/**: Documentation files in `.Rd` format generated by `roxygen2`.
- **vignettes/**: Long-form documentation written in `.Rmd` format.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and integration tests for validating package functionality.
- **data/**: Preprocessed datasets included with the package.
- **data-raw/**: Scripts used to generate or preprocess datasets.

## Key Files

- **DESCRIPTION**: Metadata about the R package, including dependencies and versioning.
- **NAMESPACE**: Exported functions and imported dependencies.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project and usage instructions.
- **NEWS.md**: Changelog documenting updates to the package.

## Analysis Guidelines

1. Focus on the core functionality in the `R/` directory.
2. Pay attention to exported functions listed in `NAMESPACE`.
3. Review dependencies specified in `DESCRIPTION` for compatibility and security.
4. Examine test coverage in the `tests/` directory to ensure all critical functions are validated.

## Exclusions

The following files and directories can be ignored during analysis:
- Temporary files (e.g., `.Rproj.user/**`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`)
- Build artifacts (e.g., `.o`, `.so`, `.dll`)
- Test outputs or logs (e.g., `*.log`, `*.tmp`)
- Development files (e.g., `dev/**`, `config.yml`)

## Security Considerations

Ensure sensitive data is excluded from analysis:
- Avoid processing files containing credentials or API keys.
- Verify that no private data is included in datasets under `data/`.
